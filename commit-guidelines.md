# Commit Guidelines

## Format
- **Title**: A descriptive, concise title that summarizes the change
- **Type**: Use "copilot" for changes assisted by GitHub Copilot
- **Description**: Use bullet points to list the changes made, avoid using \n for line breaks

## Best Practices
- Keep commits focused on a single logical change
- Use clear, descriptive language in commit messages
- Group related changes together
- Include relevant ticket/issue numbers if applicable
- For larger changes, consider breaking them into smaller, more manageable commits
